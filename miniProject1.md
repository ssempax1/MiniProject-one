## Terms:

1. Repository:  A basic element of GitHub that contains all project files and documentation, and also stores each file’s revision history. It can be labeled as public or private and can have multiple collaborators.

2. Clone: A  copy of a repository that is stored locally on a user’s computer. It is also defined as the act of making the copy.

3. Fork: A personal copy of another user’s repository that is stored on one’s account. It allows a user to make changes to the project without affecting the original repository/project.

4. Branch: A parallel version of a repository that is contained with the repo but does not affect the primary or master branch. This allows developers to work freely without disrupting the master (or main) version.
